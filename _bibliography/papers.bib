  abstract={Existing approaches have shown that, through carefully planning flight trajectories, images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used to reconstruct high-quality 3D models for real environments. These approaches greatly simplify and cut the cost of large-scale urban scene reconstruction. However, to properly capture height discontinuities in urban scenes, all state-of-the-art methods require prior knowledge on scene geometry and hence, additional prepossessing steps are needed before performing the actual image acquisition flights. To address this limitation and to make urban modeling techniques even more accessible, we present a real-time explore-and-reconstruct planning algorithm that does not require any prior knowledge for the scenes. Using only captured 2D images, we estimate 3D bounding boxes for buildings on-the-fly and use them to guide online path planning for both scene exploration and building observation. Experimental results demonstrate that the aerial paths planned by our algorithm in real-time for unknown environments support reconstructing 3D models with comparable qualities and lead to shorter flight air time.}

  abstract={Understanding transport properties in quantum nanophotonics plays a central role in designing few-photon devices, yet it suffers from a longstanding extensive computational burden. In this work, we propose a statistically driven model with a tremendously eased computational burden, which is based on the deep understanding of the few-photon spontaneous emission process. By utilizing phenomenological, statistically driven inter-photon offset parameters, the proposed model expedites the transport calculation with a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement of speed in contrast to conventional numerical approaches. We showcase the two-photon transport computation benchmarked by the rigorous analytical approach. Our work provides an efficient tool for designing few-photon nano-devices, and it significantly deepens the understanding of correlated quantum many-body physics.}
