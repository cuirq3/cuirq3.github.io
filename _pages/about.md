<p>I am a joint Ph.D. student between Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) as part of the <a href="https://map.compute.dtu.dk/">Microstructure & Plasticity (MaP)</a> group at Visual Computing, DTU Compute, under the supervision of <a href="https://people.compute.dtu.dk/janba/">J. Andreas Bærentzen</a>, <a href="https://www.drcmr.dk/timd">Tim B. Dyrby</a>, and <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts5/thiran.html/">Jean-Philippe Thiran</a>. I completed my master's degree in Human-centered Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/">DTU</a>, focusing on the Computer Graphics track. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University.</p>
    
<p>I have a broad interest in Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, particularly in geometry processing, shape representation, and synthesis. Currently, my work focuses on synthesizing reliable numerical phantoms for the neural microenvironment.</p>
