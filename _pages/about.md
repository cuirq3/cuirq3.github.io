I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Microstructure & Plasticity (MaP)](https://www.drcmr.dk/map) group at [Visual Computing](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/organisations/visual-computing), DTU Compute, under the supervision of [J. Andreas BÃ¦rentzen](https://people.compute.dtu.dk/janba/), [Tim B. Dyrby](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/tim-bj%C3%B8rn-dyrby), and [Jean-Philippe Thiran](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts5/thiran.html/). I completed my master's degree in Human-centered Artificial Intelligence at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/), focusing on the Computer Graphics track. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).
    
I have a broad interest in Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, particularly in geometry processing, shape representation, and synthesis. Currently, my work focuses on synthesizing reliable numerical phantoms for the neural microenvironment.
