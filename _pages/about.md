I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Microstructure & Plasticity (MaP)](https://www.drcmr.dk/map) group at [Visual Computing](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/organisations/visual-computing), DTU Compute, under the supervision of [J. Andreas BÃ¦rentzen](https://people.compute.dtu.dk/janba/), [Tim B. Dyrby](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/tim-bj%C3%B8rn-dyrby), and [Jean-Philippe Thiran](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts5/thiran.html/). I completed my master's degree in Human-centered Artificial Intelligence at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/), focusing on the Computer Graphics track. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).

I have a broad interest in Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, particularly in geometry processing, shape representation, and synthesis. Currently, my work focuses on synthesizing reliable numerical phantoms for the neural microenvironment.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
